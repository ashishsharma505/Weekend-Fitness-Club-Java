Overview
The Weekend Fitness Club (WFC) Booking Management Software is a system designed to streamline the process of managing fitness lesson bookings for WFC customers. This software facilitates the booking, modification, and cancellation of fitness lessons, provides lesson information, and collects customer reviews and ratings.

Features
Lesson Booking: Customers can book fitness lessons on both Saturdays and Sundays. Each lesson can accommodate up to 5 customers.

Lesson Types: Various fitness lesson types are available, including SPIN, YOGA, BODYSCULPT, ZUMBA, and more. Lesson prices vary based on the type, but the price remains consistent for the same type of lesson.

Timetable Viewing: Customers can choose to view the timetable by day (e.g., Saturday) or by fitness type (e.g., YOGA).

Booking Management: Customers can change their bookings if spaces are available and can book multiple lessons.

Cancellation: Customers have the option to cancel a booking before attending the lesson.

Review and Rating: After each lesson, customers can provide a numerical rating (1 to 5) and write a review. This information is recorded in the system.

Reporting: The software generates reports after four weeks, including the number of customers per lesson on each day and the average rating for each lesson. It also identifies the fitness lesson type generating the highest income.
